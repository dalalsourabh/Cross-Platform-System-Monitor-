# SystemCheck - Cross-Platform System Resource Monitor

A cross-platform desktop application built in C# that monitors system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage) and supports a plugin system allowing for custom integrations.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of system resources:
  - CPU usage (%)
  - Memory usage (used/total)
  - Disk usage (used/total)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Included plugins:
  - File Logger: Logs system data to a local file
  - REST API Integration: Posts system data to a configurable endpoint
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Configurable monitoring interval

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 SDK or later
- Windows, Linux, or macOS

## How to Build and Run

### Building the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the solution:

dotnet build

### Running the Application

dotnet run --project SystemCheck

## Configuration

The application can be configured through the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "MonitoringIntervalSeconds": 5,
  "ApiEndpoint": "https://localhost:7203/api/SystemData",
  "FileLogger": {
    "FilePath": "logs/system_stats.log"
  }
}
```

- `MonitoringIntervalSeconds`: Time between resource checks (in seconds)
- `ApiEndpoint`: URL for the REST API plugin to send data
- `FileLogger.FilePath`: Path where log files will be stored

## Architecture

This application follows the Clean Architecture pattern with a focus on:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Core business logic is separated from platform-specific implementations
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
3. **Extensibility**: Plugin system allows for adding new functionality without modifying core code

### Key Components

- **Core Interfaces**: Define contracts for monitoring and plugins
- **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Concrete implementations for Windows (with abstractions for other platforms)
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for adding new data consumers
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are registered and resolved at runtime

## Adding New Plugins

To create a new plugin:

1. Implement the `IMonitorPlugin` interface
2. Register the plugin in the DI container in `Program.cs`

Example:

```csharp
public class MyCustomPlugin : IMonitorPlugin
{
    public string Name => "My Custom Plugin";
    
    public Task InitializeAsync()
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    
    public Task HandleUpdateAsync(SystemResourceData data)
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

## Design Decisions and Challenges

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

The application uses a strategy pattern to abstract platform-specific monitoring code. Currently, Windows implementations is provided, but the architecture allows for easy addition of Linux and macOS implementations.

### Plugin Architecture

The plugin system uses a simple observer pattern where plugins subscribe to system resource updates. This allows for extending functionality without modifying the core monitoring logic.

### Dependency Injection

Microsoft's built-in DI container is used to manage dependencies and facilitate testing. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

## SystemCheckAPI Service

The project includes a dedicated API service to receive, store, and provide system monitoring data:

### Features

- RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/SystemData`: Receives system resource data from the monitoring application
  - `GET /api/SystemData`: Returns all stored system resource data (limited to last 100 entries)
  - `GET /api/SystemData/latest`: Returns only the most recent system resource data
- In-memory storage with thread-safe operations
- CORS support for cross-origin requests

### Running the API

```
cd SystemCheckAPI/SystemCheckAPI
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at:
- https://localhost:7080/api/SystemData (HTTPS)
- http://localhost:5080/api/SystemData (HTTP)

### Using with SystemCheck

To use the SystemCheck application with the API, update the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "ApiEndpoint": "https://localhost:7080/api/SystemData"
}
```

## Limitations

- Full monitoring support is currently implemented for Windows only
- The REST API plugin doesn't handle authentication
- No built-in visualization of historical data

### Design Decisions:

I chose a clean architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and future extensibility. The core system monitoring logic is abstracted behind interfaces, allowing platform-specific implementations (currently for Windows) to be swapped or extended easily. A plugin architecture was implemented using an observer pattern, enabling new integrations (such as file logging or REST API posting) without modifying the core logic. Dependency injection is used throughout to manage services and plugins, making the codebase modular and testable. Configuration is handled via appsettings.json for flexibility.

### Challenges:

The main challenge was ensuring cross-platform compatibility while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable. Abstracting platform-specific resource monitoring required careful interface design. Managing plugin execution and error handling in a way that doesnâ€™t impact core monitoring was also important. Cleaning up template code and resolving duplicate assembly attribute errors after removing unused files was necessary to keep the project focused and buildable. Overall the architecture supports easy addition of new plugins and platform support in the future.
